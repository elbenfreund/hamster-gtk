A GTK interface to the hamster time tracker.

**IMPORTANT**
At this early stage ``hamster-gtk`` is pre-alpha software. As such you are very
welcome to take it our for a spin and submit feedback, however you should not
rely on it to work properly and most certainly you should not use it in a
production environment!
You have been warned.

Dependencies
-------------

If you want to use the ``make register-gnome`` target ``desktop-file-install``
is required. On debian derivates this is provided by ``desktop-file-utils``.

Installing from sources:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- xmllint (Needed in order to call ``resources`` make target. On debian this is
  part of the ``libxml2-utils`` package.

To Run the Testsuite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- make
- xvfb

First Steps
------------
* Install dependencies (on debian if using virtualenvwrapper):
  install ``virtualenvwrapper python-gi gir1.2-gtk-3.0 libglib2.0-dev
  libgtk-3-dev``.
  If you use python 3, you will need ``python3-gi`` instead.
* Create new virtual env: ``mkvirtualenv hamster-gtk``
* Activate env: ``workon hamster-gtk``
* Activate system site dirs: ``toggleglobalsitepackages``. Otherwise you will
  have no access to Gtk.
* Install ``hamster-gtk``: ``pip install hamster-gtk``.
* Run the little furball: ``hamster-gtk``

Some notes:

* Preference changes will only be applied at the next start right now.
* Exported data is tab separated.
* This is pre-alpha software!

How to run the testsuite
-------------------------
- Create a virtual environment ``mkvirtualenv hamster-gtk`` (python 2) or
  ``mkvirtualenv -p python3 hamster-gtk`` (python 3). Whilst those instructions
  do not reflect best practices (which would make use of python 3's built in
  venv) it does provide a better handling of ``system-site-packages``.
  `This issue <http://bugs.python.org/issue24875>`_ provides some context for
  the problems one may run into using ``system-site-packages`` with python3
  venvs. It is our hope that python 3.7 will fix this.
- enable access to system-site-packages for our virtual environment:
  ``$ toggleglobalsitepackages``. This is needed to access our global GTK
  related packages.
- Install development environment: ``make develop``.
- To run the actual testsuite: ``make test``.
- To run tests and some auxiliary style checks (flake8, pep257, etc):
  ``make test-all``.

Right now, our actual code testing does not utilize ``tox`` as we keep running
into segfaults (which does not happen without ``tox``).
For  this same reason we are currently unable to run our code tests on Travis
as well (we still run the 'style checks' at least).
We hope to get to the bottom of this at some point and would be most grateful
if you have any hint or pointer that may help tracking down this issue.

Migrating from 'legacy hamster'
---------------------------------
In case you are wondering “Will I be able to continue using my ‘legacy
hamster’ database with this rewrite?” the answer is “yes and no.” This new
version of hamster significantly raises the standard in terms of data
consistency. Unlike before, it will not be possible to have “Facts” without
an end time specified, nor to have multiple facts overlapping.

There will be a way to import data that still constitute valid “facts” (having
both a start and an end time). We have, however, not decided on how this will
be implemented, nor what to do with the legacy “facts” that do not have
an end time.

The general timeline for addressing the actual implementation is: once we are
feature freezing in preparation of release 1.0.0 as part of a more general
pre-release cleanup effort.

Whilst possible, it is unlikely we will have the resources to provide a fancy
looking GUI to resolve migration conflicts (unless someone new pitches in of
course) so the result will most likely be a migration script of some sort.

If you are interested in this general issue, please feel free to watch the
`epic issue for
"hamster-lib" <https://projecthamster.atlassian.net/browse/LIB-12>`_ that
covers all things relevant.

News: Version 0.11.0
----------------------
This release introduces refines various aspects of your *Hamster-GTK*
experience. Whilst we introduce no new major dialogs (just a simple
about-dialog). We catch up with the lastest version of ``hamster-lib``,
``0.12.0``. The most noteworthy change for user is probably the ability to use
whitespaces with your ``Activity.name``. Besides that we fixed some rather
anoying bugs as well as continued to refine the codebase. All in all, while
still not big on features, this release should feel much more stable and
reliable. This is not the least due to multiple contributions by ``jtojnar``,
thanks for that! As ususal, for more changes and details, please refer to the
changelog. Happy tracking; Eric.
